## 📖 Overview

**SpectraX** is a cutting-edge fitness application that uses **MediaPipe Pose Detection** and **Three.js** to provide real-time workout tracking and form analysis. It doesn't just track your body; it understands your movement, counts reps (like squats), detects mistakes, and provides immersive 3D visual feedback.

The project features a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and an Express/Socket.io backend for real-time data processing and cross-device synchronization.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🏋️ **Intelligent Rep Counting**: Automatically detects and counts exercises like squats, pushups, and more.
- 📐 **Form Analysis**: Real-time feedback on exercise posture and "rep scores" based on accuracy.
- 🎥 **3D Body Mapping**: Immersive 3D skeleton rendering with WebGL/Three.js.
- 🔍 **Auto-Exercise Detection**: Uses AI to detect which exercise you are performing without manual selection.
- 📊 **Workout Summary**: Detailed post-workout analytics including rep streaks, duration, and accuracy.
- 🔄 **Replay System**: Review your performance with our built-in replay feature.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Sync**: Low-latency communication between frontend and backend via WebSockets.

## 🧠 How SpectraX Works

SpectraX uses computer vision and real-time pose estimation to analyze body movement during workouts.

### Workflow

1. 📷 Camera frames are captured in real time.
2. 🦴 MediaPipe Pose extracts 33 body landmarks.
3. 📐 Joint angles are calculated using landmark coordinates.
4. 🤖 AI logic detects the current exercise automatically.
5. 🔢 Rep counting algorithms track movement cycles.
6. 🎯 Form analysis evaluates posture accuracy.
7. 🎥 Three.js renders a live 3D body skeleton.
8. ⚡ Socket.io synchronizes workout data in real time.

This pipeline allows SpectraX to deliver immersive AI-powered fitness tracking directly in the browser.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Somil450/spectrax_1.git
   cd spectrax_1
   ```

2. **Setup Frontend**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Backend**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

## 🔐 Environment Variables

To run SpectraX locally, create environment variable files for both the frontend and backend.

### Frontend Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Backend Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` directory:

```env
PORT=3001
```

> Never commit `.env` files to version control.

### Firestore Security Rules

Rules are version-controlled in `firestore.rules`. They are not enforced until they are deployed to your Firebase project. After cloning, run:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

Without deploying these rules, the project remains in Firebase test mode (effectively open access). Always deploy them before going to production.

---

## 💻 Usage

1. **Start the Backend**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

   _Server runs on `http://localhost:3001`_

2. **Start the Frontend** (In a new terminal)

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   _App runs on `http://localhost:5173`_

3. **Workout Flow**
   - **Welcome**: Choose your exercise or let SpectraX auto-detect.
   - **Calibration**: Align yourself with the camera for optimal tracking.
   - **Workout**: Start exercising! Watch your reps count up in real-time.
   - **Summary**: Review your stats and see where you can improve.
